# ChessInJava
My Chess game written in Java 20

Tried to make sure all rules of Chess are followed and tried removing all possible bugs as well as maximizing efficiency of the code.

Use of abstract classes & methods, arrays, lists, sets, etc

Java Swing used to paint the game onto the frame

Put a lot of effort, so hope you like it <3
